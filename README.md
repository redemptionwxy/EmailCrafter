# EmailCrafter

This script uses Python's built-in email module to construct a multipart email message. It allows you to specify the sender, recipient, subject, body text, and a list of file attachments. The resulting email is saved as a .eml file, which can be opened in email clients like Outlook or Thunderbird for viewing or further processing.

Key features:

-Supports plain text body.
-Handles multiple file attachments (e.g., PDFs, images).
-Checks for attachment file existence and prints warnings if files are missing.
-Runs entirely offline.
